# Touch Typing App

This Touch Typing Website is a web application built using React and Bulma CSS, designed to help users improve their touch typing skills.

## Hosted on Netlify https://touchtyping-amiya.netlify.app/ 


### Functionality

Touch Typing App provides the following functionality:

Practice typing: AS soon as you land on the webpage and click on start button the coundown starts from 60 seconds on the screen which represents 1 minutes of time and you get 200 words of random text displayed to type correctly. after typing each word when you press sapacebar the word disappers from input feild its coded that way so don't panic, remember spacebar shifts you to the next word so dont press spacebar without any reason simply follow the text just keep typing untill the timer runs out.

Displaying WP5M and Accuracy: Once the countdown ends the number of words you typed and your accuracy gets displayed automatically.
